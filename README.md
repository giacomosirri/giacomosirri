 ## About me
 
 Hi, I'm Giacomo! 
 
 I am a computer scientist with an extreme passion for mathematical models and data. I have recently graduated in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Bologna with the highest grade. 

 I am highly skilled in designing and developing software solutions for web, mobile and desktop environments using multiple technologies and languages. I am always looking forward to working on complex 
 projects both in the open-source world and in a company environment.

 In my profile you can find some projects I've done with colleagues at university.
 
 However, the best has yet to come, so stay tuned...
 
 ## Languages
 
 The languages I have the most expertise in are C# and Python, but I am also experienced in C, Java, Javascript, PHP and Kotlin.
