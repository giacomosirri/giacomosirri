 Hi! I'm Giacomo, an Italian computer scientist passionate about software development, data science and distributed systems. I'm currently employed at Liquid Reply in Berlin, where I mainly work on the topics of cloud computing, DevOps and automation. It is no coincidence my latest repositories are made up of tutorials and trainings on GitHub Actions and Terraform!
 
## Past projects

 I have strong academic backgrounds in software development. Over the course of my bachelor I have developed — as part of group projects — applications for web (Snippex, a simple social network), mobile (GiftAlong, an Android app to pick gifts with others) and desktop (Resplan, a basic digital audio workstation). You can find all the repositories on this page. Perhaps, I will pick them up again in the next few months, but for now they are abandoned.

 I'm also very passionate about machine learning and AI. I spent my two internships at Alexide Srl on building a neural network for indoor temperature prediction, with the aim of improving the efficiency of the proprietary HVAC operator. The repository Time-Series-Forecasting contains a test implementation of a feed-forward network, trained on public data from a weather station in Jena, Germany.

 I also have some experience in more niche areas of computer science, such as computer vision and high-performance computing. There are no repos on those subjects, even though I did a fluid dynamic simulator for distributed systems while at university. Anyway, my knowledge about those fields is so far very limited.
 
 ## Languages
 
 I can program in Python, C#, Java, C, Javascript, Kotlin and PHP, roughly in descending order of proficiency.
