 ## Giacomo Sirri's Profile
 
 ## About me
 
 Hi, I'm Giacomo! 
 
 I'm a computer science student with a passion for numbers and models. 
 I'm currently attending the first semester of the final year of the Computer Science and Engineering BSc at University of Bologna, Italy. 
 
 In my profile you can find a couple of projects I did with some colleagues at my university, along with some OOP labs which I've left for future use.
 
 However, the best has yet to come, so stay tuned...
 
 ## Languages
 
 I think the key to be a great programmer is to be able to use as many languages as possible, so I'm striving to learn them while at university. 
 
 I'm currently learning to build websites and web applications in the Web Technologies course and some Python in my free time.
