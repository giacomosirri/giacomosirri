 ## About me
 
 Hi, I'm Giacomo! 
 
 I'm a computer science student with a passion for numbers and models. 
 I'm currently attending the last semester of the final year of the Computer Science and Engineering BSc at the University of Bologna, Italy. 
  My main focus right now is in the artificial intelligence field, with particular regards to the creation and training of neural networks for time series forecasting, a problem that is extremely fascinating to me.

 In my profile you can find a couple of projects I've done with colleagues at university, along with some OOP labs which I've left for future use.
 
 However, the best has yet to come, so stay tuned...
 
 ## Languages
 
 I think one of the keys to be a great software developer is to be able to use as many languages as possible, so I'm striving to learn them while at university. 
 
 At the moment, I mainly use C# and Python, though I'm also fluent in C, Java and Javascript.
